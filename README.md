### üîé Description:
grub-btrfs improves the grub bootloader by adding a btrfs snapshots sub-menu, allowing the user to boot into snapshots.

grub-btrfs supports manual snapshots as well as snapper, timeshift, and yabsnap created snapshots.

##### Warning: booting read-only snapshots can be tricky

If you wish to use read-only snapshots, `/var/log` or even `/var` must be on a separate subvolume.
Otherwise, make sure your snapshots are writable.
See [this ticket](https://github.com/Antynea/grub-btrfs/issues/92) for more info.

This project includes its own solution.
Refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/Antynea/grub-btrfs/blob/master/initramfs/readme.md).

### ‚ú® What features does grub-btrfs have?
* Automatically lists snapshots existing on the btrfs root partition.
* Automatically detect if `/boot` is in a separate partition.
* Automatically detect kernel, initramfs and Intel/AMD microcode in `/boot` directory within snapshots.
* Automatically create corresponding menu entries in `grub.cfg`
* Automatically detect the type/tags/triggers and descriptions/comments of Snapper/Timeshift/Yabsnap snapshots.
* Automatically generate `grub.cfg` if you use the provided Systemd/ OpenRC service.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation:
#### Arch Linux
The package is available in the extra repository [grub-btrfs](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/grub-btrfs/)
```
pacman -S grub-btrfs
```

#### Gentoo
grub-btrfs is only available in the Gentoo User Repository (GURU) and not in the official Gentoo repository.  
If you have not activated the GURU yet, do so by running:
```
emerge -av app-eselect/eselect-repository 
eselect repository enable guru 
emaint sync -r guru 
```
If you are using Systemd on Gentoo, make sure the USE-Flag `systemd` is set. (Either globally in make.conf or in package.use for the package app-backup/grub-btrfs)
Without Systemd USE-Flag the OpenRC-daemon of grub-btrfs will be installed.

Emerge grub-btrfs via 
`emerge app-backup/grub-btrfs`

#### Kali Linux
[grub-btrfs](http://pkg.kali.org/pkg/grub-btrfs) is available in the Kali Linux repository and can be installed with:  
```
apt install grub-btrfs
```
Booting into read-only snapshots is fully supported when choosing btrfs as the file system during a standard Kali Linux installation following [this walk-through](https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/btrfs/).

#### Manual installation
* Run `make install`

### üìö Manual usage of grub-btrfs
To manually generate grub snapshot entries you can run `sudo /etc/grub.d/41_snapshots-btrfs` which updates `grub-btrfs.cfg`. You then need to regenerate the GRUB configuration by running one of the following commands:

* On **Arch Linux** or **Gentoo** use `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`.  
* On **Fedora** use `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`  
* On **Debian and Ubuntu based** distributions `update-grub` is a script that runs `grub-mkconfig ...`

This process can be automated to occur whenever you create or delete snapshots but this process is slightly different depending upon your distributions choice on init system. See the relevant instructions for your init system below.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customization:

You have the possibility to modify many parameters in `/etc/default/grub-btrfs/config`.
For further information see [config file](https://github.com/Antynea/grub-btrfs/blob/master/config) or `man grub-btrfs`

#### Warning:
Some file locations and command names differ from distribution to distribution. Initially the configuration is set up to work with Arch and Gentoo (and many other distributions) out of the box, which are using the `grub-mkconfig` command. 
However Fedora, for example, uses a different command, `grub2-mkconfig`.
Edit the `GRUB_BTRFS_MKCONFIG` variable in `/etc/default/grub-btrfs/config` file to reflect this. (e.g. `GRUB_BTRFS_MKCONFIG=/sbin/grub2-mkconfig` for Fedora)

On most distributions, the grub installation resides in `/boot/grub`. If grub is installed in a different place, change the variable `GRUB_BTRFS_MKCONFIG` in the config file accordingly. For Fedora this is `GRUB_BTRFS_GRUB_DIRNAME="/boot/grub2"`. The command to check the grub scripts is different on some system, for Fedora it is `GRUB_BTRFS_SCRIPT_CHECK=grub2-script-check`

#### Customization of the grub-btrfsd daemon

Grub-btrfs comes with a daemon script that automatically updates the grub menu when it sees a snapshot being created or deleted in a directory it is given via command line. You must install `inotify-tools` before you can use grub-btrfsd.

The daemon can be configured by passing different command line arguments to it. 
The available arguments are:
* `SNAPSHOTS_DIRS`
This argument specifies the (space separated) paths where grub-btrfsd looks for newly created snapshots and snapshot deletions. It is usually defined by the program used to make snapshots.
E.g. for Snapper or Yabsnap this would be `/.snapshots`. It is possible to define more than one directory here, all directories will inherit the same settings (recursive etc.).
This argument is not necessary to provide if `--timeshift-auto` is set. 
* `-c / --no-color`
Disable colors in output.
* `-l / --log-file`
This arguments specifies a file where grub-btrfsd should write log messages.
* `-r / --recursive`
Watch the snapshots directory recursively
* `-s / --syslog`
* `-o / --timeshift-old`
Look for snapshots in `/run/timeshift/backup/timeshift-btrfs` instead of `/run/timeshift/$PID/backup/timeshift-btrfs.` This is to be used for Timeshift versions <22.06. You must also use `--timeshift-auto` if using this option.
* `-t / --timeshift-auto`
This is a flag to activate the auto-detection of the path where Timeshift stores snapshots. Newer versions (>=22.06) of Timeshift mount their snapshots to `/run/timeshift/$PID/backup/timeshift-btrfs`. Where `$PID` is the process ID of the currently running Timeshift session. The PID changes every time Timeshift is opened. grub-btrfsd can automatically take care of the detection of the correct PID and directory if this flag is set. In this case the argument `SNAPSHOTS_DIRS` has no effect.
* `-v / --verbose`
Let the log of the daemon be more verbose
* `-h / --help`
Displays a short help message.

### ü™Ä Automatically update grub upon snapshot creation or deletion
Grub-btrfsd is a daemon that watches the snapshot directory for you and updates the grub menu automatically every time a snapshot is created or deleted.
By default this daemon watches the directory `/.snapshots` for changes (creation or deletion of snapshots) and triggers the grub menu creation and re-installation of grub if any changes are noticed.
Therefore, if Snapper or Yabsnap is used with its default directory, the daemon can just be started and nothing needs to be configured. See the instructions below to configure grub-btrfsd for use with Timeshift or when using an alternative snapshots directory with Snapper/Yabsnap.
- - - 
#### grub-btrfsd systemd instructions
To start the daemon run:
```bash
sudo systemctl start grub-btrfsd
```

To activate it during system startup, run:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable grub-btrfsd
```

##### üíº Snapshots not in `/.snapshots` when using systemd
By default the daemon is watching the directory `/.snapshots`. If the daemon should watch a different directory, it can be edited with:
```bash
sudo systemctl edit --full grub-btrfsd 
```
You need to edit the `/.snapshots` part in the line that says `ExecStart=/usr/bin/grub-btrfsd --syslog /.snapshots`.
This is what the file should look like afterwards:
``` bash
[Unit]
Description=Regenerate grub-btrfs.cfg

[Service]
Type=simple
LogLevelMax=notice
# Set the possible paths for `grub-mkconfig`
Environment="PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin"
# Load environment variables from the configuration
EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/grub-btrfs/config
# Start the daemon, usage of it is:
# grub-btrfsd [-h, --help] [-t, --timeshift-auto] [-l, --log-file LOG_FILE] SNAPSHOTS_DIRS
# SNAPSHOTS_DIRS         Snapshot directories to watch, without effect when --timeshift-auto
# Optional arguments:
# -t, --timeshift-auto  Automatically detect Timeshifts snapshot directory
# -o, --timeshift-old   Activate for timeshift versions <22.06
# -l, --log-file        Specify a logfile to write to
# -v, --verbose         Let the log of the daemon be more verbose
# -s, --syslog          Write to syslog
ExecStart=/usr/bin/grub-btrfsd --syslog /.snapshots

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

When done, the service should be restarted with:
``` bash
sudo systemctl restart grub-btrfsd 
```

##### üåü Using Timeshift with systemd
Newer Timeshift versions (>= 22.06) create a new directory named after their process ID in `/run/timeshift` every time they are started. The PID will be different every time.
Therefore the daemon cannot simply watch a directory. It monitors `/run/timeshift` and if a directory is created it gets Timeshifts current PID then watches a directory in that newly created directory from Timeshift.
To activate this mode of the daemon, `--timeshift-auto` must be passed to the daemon as a command line argument.

To pass `--timeshift-auto` to grub-btrfsd, the .service file of grub-btrfsd can be edited with
```bash
sudo systemctl edit --full grub-btrfsd 
```

The line that contains:
```bash 
ExecStart=/usr/bin/grub-btrfsd /.snapshots --syslog

```

Should be modified to read:
``` bash
ExecStart=/usr/bin/grub-btrfsd --syslog --timeshift-auto
```

The modified file should look like this:
``` bash
[Unit]
Description=Regenerate grub-btrfs.cfg

[Service]
Type=simple
LogLevelMax=notice
# Set the possible paths for `grub-mkconfig`
Environment="PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin"
# Load environment variables from the configuration
EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/grub-btrfs/config
# Start the daemon, usage of it is:
# grub-btrfsd [-h, --help] [-t, --timeshift-auto] [-l, --log-file LOG_FILE] SNAPSHOTS_DIRS
# SNAPSHOTS_DIRS         Snapshot directories to watch, without effect when --timeshift-auto
# Optional arguments:
# -t, --timeshift-auto  Automatically detect Timeshifts snapshot directory
# -l, --log-file        Specify a logfile to write to
# -v, --verbose         Let the log of the daemon be more verbose
# -s, --syslog          Write to syslog
ExecStart=/usr/bin/grub-btrfsd --syslog --timeshift-auto

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If you are using an older release of Timeshift (before 22.06), you also need to add `--timeshift-old` so that your ExecStart line would look like:

```
ExecStart=/usr/bin/grub-btrfsd --syslog --timeshift-auto --timeshift-old
```

When done, the service must be restarted with:
``` bash
sudo systemctl restart grub-btrfsd 
```

Note:
You can view your change with `systemctl cat grub-btrfsd`.
To revert all the changes use `systemctl revert grub-btrfsd`.

- - -
#### grub-btrfsd OpenRC instructions
To start the daemon run:
```bash
sudo rc-service grub-btrfsd start 
```

To activate it during system startup, run:
```bash
sudo rc-config add grub-btrfsd default 
```

##### üíº Snapshots not in `/.snapshots` for OpenRC
By default the daemon is watching the directory `/.snapshots`. If the daemon should watch a different directory, it can be edited by passing different arguments to it.
Arguments are passed to grub-btrfsd via the file `/etc/conf.d/grub-btrfsd`. 
The variable `snapshots` defines the path the daemon will monitor for snapshots.

After editing, the file should look like this:
``` bash
# Copyright 2022 Pascal Jaeger
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3

## Where to locate the root snapshots
snapshots="/.snapshots" # Snapper in the root directory
#snapshots="/run/timeshift/backup/timeshift-btrfs/snapshots" # Timeshift < v22.06

## Optional arguments to run with the daemon
# Append options to this like this:
# optional_args="--syslog --timeshift-auto --verbose"
# Possible options are:
# -t, --timeshift-auto  Automatically detect Timeshifts snapshot directory for timeshift >= 22.06
# -o, --timeshift-old   Look for snapshots in directory of Timeshift <v22.06 (requires --timeshift-auto)
# -l, --log-file        Specify a logfile to write to
# -v, --verbose         Let the log of the daemon be more verbose
# -s, --syslog          Write to syslog
optional_args="--syslog"
```

After that, the daemon should be restarted with:
``` bash
sudo rc-service grub-btrfsd restart
```

##### üîí Snapshots on LUKS encrypted devices
By default, grub-btrfs generates entries that does not load modules for dealing with encrypted devices.
Enable the `GRUB_BTRFS_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK` variable in `/etc/default/grub-btrfs/config` to load said modules and then execute the steps to mount encrypted root after selecting the snapshot.

### Troubleshooting
If you experience problems with grub-btrfs don't hesitate [to file an issue](https://github.com/Antynea/grub-btrfs/issues/new/choose).

#### What version of grub-btrfs am I running?
When requesting help or reporting bugs in grub-btrfs, please run:
``` bash
sudo /etc/grub.d/41_snapshots-btrfs --version
```
or 
``` bash
sudo /usr/bin/grub-btrfsd --help
```
to get the currently running version of grub-btrfs and include this information in your ticket.

#### Running grub-btrfsd in verbose mode
If you have problems with the daemon, you can run it with the `--verbose`-flag. To do so you can run:
``` bash
sudo /usr/bin/grub-btrfsd --verbose --timeshift-auto` (for timeshift)
# or 
sudo /usr/bin/grub-btrfsd /.snapshots --verbose` (for snapper/yabsnap)
```
Or pass `--verbose` to the daemon using the Systemd .service file or the OpenRC conf.d file respectively.

For additional information on the daemon and its arguments, run `grub-btrfsd -h` or `man grub-btrfsd`

### Development
Grub-btrfs uses a rudimentary system of automatic versioning to tell apart different commits. This is helpful when users report problems and it is not immediately clear what version they are using. 
We therefore have the following script in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

``` bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "Doing pre commit hook with version bump"
version="$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)-$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)-$(date -u -Iseconds)"
echo "New version is ${version}"
sed -i "s/GRUB_BTRFS_VERSION=.*/GRUB_BTRFS_VERSION=${version}/" config
git add config
```

This automatically sets the version in the `config`-file to `[lasttag]-[branch-name]-[current-date-in-UTC]`.
In order to create a Tag we don't want to have this long version. In this case we set the version manually in `config` and commit with `git commit --no-verify`. This avoids running the hook.
